TRANSACTIONS AND ERROR HANDLING
	Transaction is a single unit of work. If the transaction encounters a problem, all the data modifications are rolled back and erased.

ACID PROPERTIES:
	ATOMICITY, CONSISTENCY, ISOLATION, DURABILTY

		A. Transaction should be all or nothing. Either successful or roll-back.
		C. Any taransaction will bring the database from one valid state to another
		I. Ensures that the concurrent execution of transactions results in a system state 
			that would be obtained if transactions were executed serially
		D. Once a transaction has been commmited, it will remain so, even in the event of power loss, crashes, errors.
