SQL User Defined Functions:
	-Like functions in programming languages, SQL Server user-defined functions are routines that accept parameters, perfoms an action as a 
	comlplex calculations, and return the result of that action as a value. 
	-The return value can either be a  single scalar value or a result set.
	
	User defined functions can be used inline.

Types of functions:
	Scalar: returns single value
	Table-Valued: returns a table of values
	System: they are defined by system which can not be modified.
