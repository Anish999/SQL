SQL Computed Columns
	These columns have values derived from other columns
	Example:
		-Suppose Employee table has Firstname and lastname columns and we need Fullname, 
		we would compute the Firstname by combining First and last names witout asking 
		users to inpu the actual "Full name"
		-Calculating Standard Deviations and stuffs like that based on the other user inputs

	Creating Computed Columns:
		GUI based approach
			-create new table
			-create columns
			-for the computed columns, go to computed column specification and add formula
			-now edit table and see the computed column auto complete
		Or, manually create them
